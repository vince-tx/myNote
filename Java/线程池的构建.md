# 线程池的构建（参数介绍和简单场景示例）

Executors提供了几种线程池的工厂方法，也可以使用ThreadPoolExecutor进行自定义的线程池构建。

jdk文档如下介绍
 > When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute(Runnable)},
 > and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 > created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 > idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 > maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 > if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 > the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 > maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 > Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 > number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 > sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 > dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link
 > #setMaximumPoolSize}. <br> <br>
 > 当新任务提交时，此时若少于核心线程数的线程正在运行，将会创建一个新的线程去处理请求,即使还有其他空闲的工作线程。如果当前运行线程数大于核心线程数但小于最大线程数，只有当任务队列满了时才会创建新线程来处理请求。
